# Analysis-of-Happiness-Regional-Variations.Paschal-Uzoegwu-21063051.ADS-Assignment.
Analysis examining the variations in happiness scores across different regions. The objective is to identify significant variations in happiness scores among these regions. The dataset contains information on Gross Domestic Product, average income,happiness scores and  region for 111 countries.

The dataset includes the following key variables:

Happiness Score: A numerical value representing the level of happiness reported by individuals in each country and is denoted with “happyScore”.

Average Income: The term "avg_income" denotes the average income per person in each nation.

Region: The geographic region that each nation is a part of is indicated by this categorical variable.

### Analysing the regional variations in happiness scores (happyScore).

To analyze regional variations in happiness scores, the following steps were taken:

Notebook set up:
Dataset reading and importing necessary libraries for the data cleaning and analysis as well as plotting happiness score regional variations.

Data Exploration:
To determine how happiness scores and average income varied by region, a preliminary examination of the dataset was done.

Descriptive Statistics:
To find central patterns and variability, descriptive statistics were computed for each region's happiness levels, including mean, median, and standard deviation.

Visualisation:
To examine correlations with average income and depict the distribution of happiness scores across each region, several visualisations were made, including heatmap, vertical bar charts, and scatter plots.

### Analysis.
The visualisations were analyzed to identify any notable patterns or trends in happiness scores across regions. Potential relationships between happiness scores and average income were also investigated.

### Insights.

##### Regional Differences:
Significant variations in happiness scores were observed across different regions. Some regions exhibited higher average happiness scores compared to others. Australia and New Zealand having the highest happiness variation scores with Sub-Saharan Africa with the least happiness score.

##### Income-Happiness Relationship:
There appears to be a positive correlation between average income and happiness scores in certain regions. Countries with higher average incomes tended to report higher happiness scores, with western Europe having the highest happiness score and highest average income showing a positive correlation of 0.78 between the average income and happy score.

##### Heatmap Analysis:
The heatmap depicts the correlation between different factors in the dataset. It appears to be a positive correlation between average income and happiness scores (HappyScore) the correlation being 0.78. The warmer colors (such as red) imply a positive association, whereas cooler colors (such as blue) suggest a negative relationship. The numbers in the cells indicate the intensity and direction of the link. This visualization identifies patterns and relationships between variables in the dataset.

The analysis on the top 20 countries by GDP variation reveals a discernible relationship between GDP across the top 20 countries. While the correlation is generally positive, variations exist due to the average income per GDP, diverse socio-economic and cultural contexts.

##### Outliers:
Some outliers were identified within certain regions, indicating potential discrepancies between reported happiness scores and average income levels.

### Conclusion
The analysis of happiness regional variations provides valuable insights into the factors influencing happiness levels across different geographical regions. While income is one of the factors contributing to happiness, other socio-economic and cultural factors may also play a significant role.
